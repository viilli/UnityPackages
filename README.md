# UnityPackages
Custom packages for unity. Like editor scripts. All of them are opencource and they all have CC (creative commons) license, so you can use it for anything and you can edit them freely. If you found a bug, please make an issue or if you are brave enough you can make a pull request (I don't know how that works). 

To use these packages, place them inside **your Assets folder**. You can** make a subfolde**r for these scripts. Just remember the folder where these they should be is **named Editor**. That folder can be anywhere.

**2DVector3ArrayEditor** is editor window for editing vector3 arrays (not lists). **This works only in 2D** It has features to **add points to specific array by clicking "o" or "F15"** in scene view. It adds a point where the cursor is. You can **delete the point by clicking again** that point or in the window. You can also **move the point by holding on of those buttons down** and by moving the cursor.Use the **hand tool for those modifications** as other tools select other objects. You can find this window from **Window/2DEditor/2DVector3ArrayEditor**. it requires **ArrayHander**, **EditorInputManager**, **EditorSceneExtension** and **WebManager** to work correcly. They are my custom extensions and libraries.
